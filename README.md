## What is LocalTerra?

LocalTerra is a complete Terra testnet and ecosystem containerized with Docker and orchestrated with a simple `docker-compose` file. LocalTerra is designed to make it easy for smart contract developers to test out their contracts in a sandboxed environment before moving to a live testnet or mainnet.

LocalTerra comes pre-configured with opinionated, sensible defaults for standard testing environments. If other projects mention testing on LocalTerra, they are referring to the settings defined in this repo.

The advantages of LocalTerra over a public testnet:

- Easily modifiable world states
- quick to resets for quick iterations
- easy simulations of different scenarios
- Controllable validator behavior

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and configured on your system
- [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)
- Supported known architecture: x86_64

## Usage

1. Install LocalTerra:

```sh
$ git clone --depth 1 https://www.github.com/terra-money/LocalTerra
$ cd LocalTerra
```

2. Make sure your Docker daemon is running in the background and [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose) is installed.

3. Start LocalTerra:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

Your environment now contains:

- [terrad](http://github.com/terra-money/core) RPC node running on `tcp://localhost:26657`
- LCD running on http://localhost:1317
- [FCD](http://www.github.com/terra-money/fcd) running on http://localhost:3060
- An oracle feeder feeding live prices from mainnet, trailing by 1 vote period

### Turn off and restart

To turn off LocalTerra:

```sh
$ docker-compose stop
```

To reset the world state:

```sh
$ docker-compose rm
```

## Integrations

### Terra Station

Terra Station has built-in support for LocalTerra, which enables you to interact with your LocalTerra. Open up station and switch to the `Localterra` network:

![station_localterra](./img/station-localterra.png)

### terrad

**NOTE:** 'terracli' has been deprecated and all of its functionalities have been merged into 'terrad'.

1. Make sure you have the same version of `terrad` installed as LocalTerra.

2. Use `terrad` to talk to your LocalTerra `terrad` node:

```sh
$ terrad status
```

This automatically works because `terrad` connects to `localhost:26657` by default. More explicitly:

```sh
$ terrad status --node=tcp://localhost:26657
```

3. You can now issue normal commands with `terrad` against your LocalTerra network:

```sh
$ terrad query account terra1dcegyrekltswvyy0xy69ydgxn9x8x32zdtapd8
```

### Terra SDK for Python

Connect to the chain through LocalTerra's LCD server:

```python
from terra_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient
terra = LCDClient("localterra", "http://localhost:1317")
```

### Terra.js

Connect to the chain using `LCDClient` against LocalTerra's LCD server:

```ts
import { LCDClient } from "@terra-money/terra.js";

const terra = new LCDClient({
  URL: "http://localhost:1317",
  chainID: "localterra",
});
```

## Configuring LocalTerra

The majority of LocalTerra is implemented through a `docker-compose.yml` file making it easily customizable. You can use LocalTerra as a starting template point for setting up your own local Terra testnet with Docker containers.

Out-of-the-box, LocalTerra comes preconfigured with opinionated settings such as:

- ports defined for RPC (26657), LCD (1317) and FCD (3060)
- standard [accounts](#accounts) (shown below)

### Modifying Node Configuration

You can modify the node configuration of your validator in `config/config.toml` and `config/app.toml`.

#### PRO TIP: Speed Up Block Time

LocalTerra is often used alongside a script written with Terra.js or Terra Python SDK as a convenient way to do integration tests. You can greatly improve the experience by speeding up the block time.

To increase block time, edit the `[consensus]` parameters located in `config/config.toml` and input your desired values.

The following example configures all timeouts to `200ms`:

```diff
##### consensus configuration options #####
[consensus]

wal_file = "data/cs.wal/wal"
- timeout_propose = "3s"
- timeout_propose_delta = "500ms"
- timeout_prevote = "1s"
- timeout_prevote_delta = "500ms"
- timeout_precommit_delta = "500ms"
- timeout_commit = "5s"
+ timeout_propose = "200ms"
+ timeout_propose_delta = "200ms"
+ timeout_prevote = "200ms"
+ timeout_prevote_delta = "200ms"
+ timeout_precommit_delta = "200ms"
+ timeout_commit = "200ms"
```

You can also use the following single line to configure timeouts:

```sh
sed -E -i '/timeout_(propose|prevote|precommit|commit)/s/[0-9]+m?s/200ms/' config/config.toml
```

### Modifying Genesis

You can change the `genesis.json` file by altering `config/genesis.json`. Restart your LocalTerra to load your changes.

## Accounts

LocalTerra is pre-configured with one validator and 10 accounts with LUNA balances.
